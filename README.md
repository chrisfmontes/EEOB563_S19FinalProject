## Introduction  
In order to orchestrate a successful response to (biotic and abiotic) environmental changes, plants need to balance and coordinate their grow and stress responses.
Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a steroidal plant hormone family known to be involved in a myriad of plant growth-related processes. Such as cell division/elongation and reproductive development.  
The GSK3-like kinase BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2) is a key negative regulator of BR signaling response. This enzyme is known to phosphorylate the BR-reponsive transcription factor (TF) BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1), preventing its nuclear accumulation and helping promote BES1 proteosomal degradation.
