  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 2
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX
  parallelization: PTHREADS (16 threads), thread pinning: OFF

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 3149 patterns

Partition 0: noname

Alignment sites / patterns: 4512 / 3149
Gaps: 76.90 %
Invariant sites: 13.70 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: R1_blos.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (16) for your alignment with 3149 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
