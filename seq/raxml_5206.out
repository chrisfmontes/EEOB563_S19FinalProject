[00:00:00] Loaded alignment with 500 taxa and 4514 sites

WARNING: Fully undetermined columns found: 2

NOTE: Reduced alignment (with duplicates and gap-only sites/taxa removed)

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 3149 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: BLOSUM62
Alignment sites / patterns: 4512 / 3149
Gaps: 76.90 %
Invariant sites: 13.70 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: R1_blo.raxml.rba


WARNING: You might be using too many threads (16) for your alignment with 3149 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
