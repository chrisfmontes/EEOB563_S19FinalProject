RAxML-NG was called at 15-Apr-2019 23:08:02 as follows:

raxml-ng --all --msa RAPTORB_NCBI_BLAST_viridiplantae250hits_alignment.fasta --model Blosum62 --prefix R1_blos --seed 2 --threads 4

Analysis options:
  run mode: ML tree search + bootstrapping (Felsenstein Bootstrap)
  start tree(s): random (10) + parsimony (10)
  bootstrap replicates: max: 1000 + bootstopping (autoMRE, cutoff: 0.030000)
  random seed: 2
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX
  parallelization: PTHREADS (4 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (Blosum62) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
